This is my final year project at that I completed as part of my dissertation at Bangor University. This project was submitted alongside a 10,000 word dissertation discussing and evaluating the different methods of geographic data visualisation.

The project uses a choropleth map to display the population density of each local authority in England. There is a secondary data set that shows the relationship between population density and the total population of each local authority on a scatter graph.
The map has interactive features to provide the user with more insights about the data.

The project uses the local authority data from https://martinjc.github.io/UK-GeoJSON/ which is held in a geoJSON file. This data was then combined with a csv file from the National office of statistics to give each local authority the property of population density.
The project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The base layer for the map visualisation is leaflet.js because it provides a base for the geometric data that is stored in the geoJSON file.
